# Week-9-pentesting

Time Spent: 5 hours

<h2> Red: Vulnerability IDOR  </h2>

Summary: The url in the find a salesperson page is vulnerable to idor exploits because the employee id in the url can be changed. Change the id to 10 to find Testy McTesterson, which will not be public until Sept 1st. And change the id to 11 to find an employee who was fired for stealing. See gif below for visual walthrough.

<h2> Blue: Vulnerability SQLI  </h2>

Summary: The blue website is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack on the salesperson page. I added ' AND SLEEP(5)--' after the id and the page paused for 5 seconds before loading to terretories.php page.

<h2> Green: Vulnerability XSS  </h2>

Summary: I entered a fake name:hacker and email:hacker@email.com in the comments section. Then I injected the code <script>alert('This is XSS!!!');</script>
Note: Somebody made an xss attempt before me and their alert pops up before mine. The next two alerts are from me.

<h4>Notes and Issues</h4>
The xss on the green website confused me because alerts from other people where showing before mine. This had me momentarily confused because I expected my alert to pop up immediately. I tried a few Sql injections for the blue site before finding ' AND SLEEP(5)--'. I believe that OR can be used in place of AND as well.
